# ðŸŒ¾ Crop Recommendation System using Machine Learning

A machine learning-based web application that recommends the most suitable crop to cultivate based on soil nutrients and weather conditions. This project aims to support farmers and agriculturists in making data-driven crop choices to increase productivity and sustainability.

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used

- **Python** â€“ Backend & Model
- **Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn** â€“ Data preprocessing & Machine Learning
- **Flask** â€“ Backend server
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** â€“ Frontend
- **Google Colab** â€“ Model training & analysis
- **Optional: Weather API (OpenWeatherMap)** â€“ For fetching real-time weather conditions *(not mandatory)*

## ðŸ“¦ Dataset

**Features:**
- `N` â€“ Nitrogen content in the soil
- `P` â€“ Phosphorous content in the soil
- `K` â€“ Potassium content in the soil
- `Temperature` â€“ In Â°C
- `Humidity` â€“ In %
- `pH` â€“ Acidity level of the soil
- `Rainfall` â€“ In mm

## ðŸ”® Model

- **Algorithm:** Random Forest Classifier  
- **Accuracy:** 95%  
- Trained on the provided dataset with preprocessing and feature scaling.
